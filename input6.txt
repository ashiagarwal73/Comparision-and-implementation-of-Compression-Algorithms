Design
See also: Algorithm ยง By design paradigm
Algorithm design refers to a method or mathematical process for problem-solving and engineering algorithms. The design of algorithms is part of many solution theories of operation research, such as dynamic programming and divide-and-conquer. Techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are also called algorithm design patterns,[29] such as the template method pattern and decorator pattern.
One of the most important aspects of algorithm design is creating an algorithm that has an efficient run-time, also known as its Big O.
Typical steps in the development of algorithms:
    Problem definition
    Development of a model
    Specification of the algorithm
    Designing an algorithm
    Checking the correctness of the algorithm
    Analysis of algorithm
    Implementation of algorithm
    Program testing
    Documentation preparation
Implementation

Most algorithms are intended to be implemented as computer programs. However, algorithms are also implemented by other means, such as in a biological neural network (for example, the human brain implementing arithmetic or an insect looking for food), in an electrical circuit, or in a mechanical device.
